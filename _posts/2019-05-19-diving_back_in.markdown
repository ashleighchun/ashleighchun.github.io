The CLI final project has been a jumping off point for my time in the full time bootcamp. I had done the part time bootcamp for a few months previously but had taken some time off before joining my current cohort. 

The timing couldn't have been better for me to join the full time program! The fact that my first assignment back was this project allowed me to review every technique that had been covered in the bootcamp so far. For everyone else, this was a final project for the last month's work. For me, it was a refresher on material I had been chewing on slowly for quite some time. 

Starting out was intimidating! I was unsure of how much I may have forgotten and this was my first real shot at working in my terminal and atom directly instead of the Learn IDE. After some mental blocks looking at the abyss that was my empty file, I started outlining some pseoudocode that I hoped would inspire me and send me in the right direction. By methodically working through the steps to set up my environment, one  requirement and file at a time, and then tackeling my methods, I was able to create a CLI interface and scrape 2 websites! 

The most eye opening moment was when my environment was all set and my files were prepped for coding in. This was when my perspective of the coding process shifted. I realized that laying out the environment was like establishing a blueprint for a building or an outline for an essay. It felt like a fundamental visual and mental aid to enable me to code with a more omnipotent vantage point instead of just with blinders focused solely on a single method or 2 intereacting methods. 

What an awesome shift in perspective!
