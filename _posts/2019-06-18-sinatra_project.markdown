This project has been full of very detailed route building and debugging. Considering my ability to navigate atom when I first began working within the editor environment, and now, I can see I have made major advancements in my understanding. That being said, it seems as if the advancement in understanding allows me to gain perspective on how much I still have to learn. It is as if you're in a foggy room and you find a door and beyond that door you can see just a bit further in the fog than before! 

I am excited to get to the rails section because I can see that it will give me an even clearer vantage point in relation to activerecord and sinatra.
