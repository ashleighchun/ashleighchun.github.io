I finally got into my groove in this section and began feeling the fun aspect of putting together this working machine filled with cohesive parts to finish with a fully functioning website. About half way through my project I realized I was actually making a website and it may sound like a small feat but after being so deeply emersed in labs that focused on separate functionalities, it was like lifting the veil and finally getting a glimpse of the possibilities in building the separate functionalities into something that makes sense in the real world. So great!
